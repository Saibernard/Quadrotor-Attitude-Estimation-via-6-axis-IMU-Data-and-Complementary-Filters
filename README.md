# Quadrotor-Attitude-Estimation-via-6-axis-IMU-Data-and-Complementary-Filters
This repository offers a deep dive into quadrotor attitude determination using a 6-axis IMU. Leveraging the EuRoc dataset from ETH Zurich, the project adopts a complementary filter approach for precise attitude estimation.
